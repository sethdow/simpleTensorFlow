\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Ecosystem diversity and human activity in dry climates depend not just on the magnitude of rainfall, but also on the landscape\'92s ability to retain water. This is illustrated dramatically in the High Plains of North America, where despite the semi-arid modern and past climate, the hydrologic conditions are diverse. Large rivers sourced in the Rocky Mountains cut through elevated plains that exhibit limited river drainage but widespread surface water in the form of ephemeral (seasonal) playa lakes{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0532-1#ref-CR1"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs27 \cf4 \strokec4 1}}, as well as extensive groundwater hosted in the High Plains aquifer of the Ogallala formations{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0532-1#ref-CR2"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs27 \cf4 \strokec4 2}}. Here we present a model, with supporting evidence, which shows that the High Plains landscape is currently in a transient state, in which the landscape has bifurcated into an older region with an inefficient river network and a younger, more efficient, river channel network that is progressively cannibalizing the older region. The older landscape represents the remnants of the Ogallala sediments that once covered the entirety of the High Plains, forming depositional fans that buried the pre-existing river network and effectively \'91repaved\'92 the High Plains{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0532-1#ref-CR3"}}{\fldrslt

\fs36 . Today we are witnessing the establishment of a new river network that is dissecting the landscape, capturing channels and eroding these sediment fans. Through quantitative analysis of the geometry of the river network, we show how network reorganization has resulted in a distinctive pattern of erosion, whereby the largest rivers have incised the older surface, removed fan heads near the Rocky Mountains and eroded the fan toes, but left portions of the central fan surface and the Ogallala sediments largely intact. These preserved fan surfaces have poor surface water drainage, and thus retain ephemeral water for wetlands and groundwater recharge. Our findings suggest that the surface hydrology and associated ecosystems are transient features on million-year timescales, and reflect the mode of landscape evolution.\

Our results suggest that landscapes with slowly moving drainage divides might not reach equilibrium, and that river basin dynamics may contribute to setting the large-scale morphology of old cratonic landscapes.\

However, the processes controlling the occurrence and characteristics of drumbeat, and LP earthquakes more generally, remain contested. Here we use new quantitative tools to describe the emergence, evolution, and degradation of drumbeat LP\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/seismicity"}}{\fldrslt \cf6 \strokec6 seismicity}}\'a0at the andesitic Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador, in April 2015. The signals were recorded during an episode of minor explosive activity and ash emission, without lava effusion, and are the first to be reported at Tungurahua during the ongoing 17 yrs of eruption. Following four days of high levels of continuous and \'91pulsed\'92 tremor, highly-periodic LP earthquakes first appear on 10 April. Over the next four days, inter-event times and event amplitudes evolve through a series of step-wise transitions between stable behaviors, each involving a decrease in the degree of periodicity. Families of similar\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/waveform"}}{\fldrslt \cf6 \strokec6 waveforms}}\'a0persist before, during, and after drumbeat activity, but the activity levels of different families change coincidentally with transitions in event rate, amplitude, and periodicity. A complex micro-seismicity \'91initiation\'92 sequence shows pulse-like and stepwise changes in inter-event times and amplitudes in the hours preceding the onset of drumbeat activity that indicate a partial de-coupling between event size and rate. The observations increase the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/phenomenology"}}{\fldrslt \cf6 \strokec6 phenomenology}}\'a0of drumbeat LP earthquakes, and suggest that at Tungurahua they result from gas flux and rapid depressurization controlled by shear failure of the margins of the ascending magma column.\

Previous studies found that mobile lid convection typically erases heterogeneity within 
\f4 \uc0\u8764

However, using two-dimensional Cartesian convection models that include grainsize evolution, we find that mobile lid convection can preserve heterogeneity at high mantle temperature conditions for much longer than previously thought, because higher mantle temperatures lead to larger grainsizes in the lithosphere. These larger grainsizes result in stronger plate boundaries that act to slow down surface and interior convective motions, in competition with the direct\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/anisotropy"}}{\fldrslt \cf6 \strokec6 effect temperature}}\'a0has on mantle viscosity. Our models indicate that mobile lid convection can preserve heterogeneity for \uc0\u8776 0.4\'961 Gyrs at early\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/earth-mantle"}}{\fldrslt \cf6 \strokec6 Earth mantle}}\'a0temperatures when the initial heterogeneity has the same viscosity as the background mantle, and \uc0\u8776 1\'964 Gyrs when the heterogeneity is ten times more viscous than the background mantle. Thus, stagnant lid convection is not required to explain long-term survival of early formed geochemical heterogeneities, though these heterogeneities having an elevated viscosity compared to the surrounding mantle may be essential for their preservation.\

The bulk meteorite sample and the individual chondrules extracted from it were measured using the X-Tek HMX ST 225 CT System at the Natural History Museum, London. A 0.25 mm copper filter was used to remove low-energy x-rays. Once the chondrules were extracted, they were mounted on carbon stubs of 11 mm height and 6 mm diameter in the center. A fine etch was made into the stubs so that the position of the chondrules maintained the same during micro-CT and magnetic measurements. Scanning in batches of four, 40 chondrules from Bjurb\'f6le and 19 chondrules from Vigarano were imaged.

The chapter introduces the error types and their relation to accuracy and precision terms, and the statistical accuracy indices of the variance and standard errors. Then the connection between the probability normal distribution curve and the geomatical observations is illustrated with both numerical and MATLAB examples. Probable error at different confidence limits is given with a simple approach of blunders rejection. This chapter also also illustrates the most important method of adjustment using the least squares principle and its mathematical derivation. Finally, the computation of the weighted mean is shown in a numerical example.\
In this chapter, error propagation technique is presented using algebraic methods including matrices. The important variance-covariance matrix of observations and unknowns is described and computed using the Jacobian matrices. Similarly, preanalysis procedure is presented in three different examples where different mathematical solutions are shown. Other algebraic terms like Kronecker product and generalized inverse will be illustrated. Nine different numerical examples with their MATLAB codes are given in detail for better understanding.\
In this chapter the Geomatics models adjustment using least squares method is introduced using the condition equations or the observation equations. Furthermore, the graphical representation of the positioning error using the traditional way of ellipse of errors is shown either for the standard or the relative indexes. Since the book is emphasizing on three dimensional applications, the ellipsoid of errors is also presented. Finally, the concept of homogeneous least squares method is also introduced with solved examples.\

The proportion of POM to SS mobilised in rivers under base flow is an important component of carbon flux to oceans, and is a useful metric for understanding hillslope\'96river coupling and hydraulic connectivity. We quantified POM during base flow conditions in southern New Zealand to assess the role of different catchment characteristics that control the spatial variability of organic matter in the fluvial environment. The proportion of POM to total suspended material (TSM) can be <5%, or much higher at 50\'9680% across southern New Zealand, with the highest concentrations associated with lowland agricultural catchments.

The POM% responds to both intrinsic and extrinsic catchment characteristics, affecting the availability of organic material and mechanisms for transport including vegetation cover, topographic controls, and hydrological controls. Across southern New Zealand it is evident that riverine organic matter is spatially organised and connected to broader hillslope processes, albeit difficult to predict at the catchment scale.\
Predicting landslide occurrence is of key importance for understanding the geomorphological development of mountain environments as well as to assess the potential risk posed by landsliding to human societies in such environments. Global landslide susceptibility models use a generic model formulation to predict landslide susceptibility anywhere on the planet from openly available data. Regional models, on the contrary, use local information on landslide occurrence to constrain model parameters and may also benefit from better spatial information with respect to controlling factors. This study aims to investigate the added value of the construction of regional landslide susceptibility models (versus global and continental models) in the western branch of the East African Rift, a data-scarce landslide-prone tropical environment. First, a comprehensive landslide database containing 6446 instances was compiled for the study area using Google Earth imagery. Second, three regional data-driven landslide susceptibility models were developed. Third, the efforts to construct these regional models were quantified by analysing how their quality is impacted by (1) the use of more accurate, regional peak ground acceleration and geology data, and (2) an increasing inventory size. Fourth, regional and global/continental models were compared in terms of predictive power and geomorphological plausibility. We observe that global/continental landslide susceptibility models are capable of identifying landslide-prone areas, but lack prediction power and geomorphological plausibility when compared to our regional models. Importantly, this difference in quality is not driven by the use of more accurate and detailed geology and peak ground acceleration data, but rather by the use of a detailed regional landslide inventory to calibrate the models. We also show that the model quality only increases marginally beyond a certain inventory size. We conclude that the regional landslide susceptibility assessment does provide an added value compared to existing global models in terms of geomorphological plausibility and model performance, whereby the largest gain is to be found in the construction of a regional landslide inventory, rather than the investment in more detailed covariates or the application of more complex modelling techniques. The latter suggests that the role of controlling variables depends, to some extent, on the regional context: making adequate susceptibility predictions proves difficult when local conditions are not accounted for by means of a regional inventory.
